      Create a third page (timeline.html) -- a timeline that shows all tweets from both users sorted in order of posted date
      
      Sort the tweets from most recent to least recent:
      1. create the data structures you need before appending anything to the DOM
      2. sort, filter, and "process" the data however you need to
      3. append to the DOM once your data is already the "shape" you want

      In this particular case, "process" the data by:
      1. getting all the tweets, regardless of user, into a single array (in your case you'd need to "extract" the tweets from each user object, and then push them into a common array)
      2. sort this "all tweets" array by date, with a sort function that uses date objects in the body
      3. once you have the tweets in a single array, ready to go, you can basically append them to the DOM in a very straightforward way

      Hope that helps!
